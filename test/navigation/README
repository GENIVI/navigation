This folder contains some stuff for testing.

-----------------------------------
Python scripts for unitary testing:
-----------------------------------

In order to test the navigation core, please do:
Into a terminal
cd ../../src/navigation/script
./run -r 
NB: Another way to check the state of the process is to run in separate xterms:
./run -rx

Into another terminal
cd ../../../test/navigation/
python test-route-calculation.py

You can see some debug messages into the terminal

To clean up the navigation core, please do:
kill -9 `ps -ef | grep navit | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'`


For intensive unitary testing of enhanced position with log replayer
If you launch it from the formal navigation repos, just do
python intensive-testing.py
It will run the test at 5 frames per sec or can be set by parameter (duration 20 sec)
If you launch it from the navigation-application repos, just do
python intensive-testing.py -p ../../../../

-----------------------------------

-----------------------------------

The bustle code has been patched for Genivi.
