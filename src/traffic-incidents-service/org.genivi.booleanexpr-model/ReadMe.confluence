This project defines a Boolean Expression.
These expressions are used in the TrafficIncidents interface, but can also be used in other locations where hierarchical data is used.
Detailed information can be found in the "GENIVI TrafficIncidentsService Component Specification".

In the model folder, FilterExpr.ecore defines the Boolean Expressions. The Family.ecore model is only used for testing.
FilterExpr.ecorediag provides a good overview of the structure of a Boolean Expression.
