libmatthew-java installation guide
-----------------------------

To compile libmatthew-java you will need a Java 1.4 or better JDK, and a
standard unix build environment including a C compiler.

The libraries can be compiled and installed with `make' and `make install'
respectively. By default they will be installed into /usr/local/share/java and
/usr/local/lib/jni. This location can be configured by giving PREFIX, JARDIR
and LIBDIR variables to make.
