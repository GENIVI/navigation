Project:
Navigation software based on Navit and compliant with the Navigation APIs standardized by the GENIVI Alliance
This project is one of the navigation-service common projects that implements the GENIVI navigation APIs.

More:
The GENIVI APIs are implemented into navit plugins, running on DBus. The HMI is made in Qml
See also other navigation projects like proof of concepts implemented for poi-service, traffic-info and positioning 

What is in:
This folder contains scripts for building Navit and the GENIVI plugins. It runs only the navigation middleware (without the HMI)
FYI: the application (with the HMI) is located into git://git.projects.genivi.org/lbs/navigation-application.git
     it's possible to build and run the whole stuff directly from that repository
