Project:
Navigation software based on Navit and compliant with the Navigation APIs standardized by the GENIVI Alliance
This project is one of the navigation-service common projects that implements the GENIVI navigation APIs.

More:
The GENIVI APIs are implemented into navit plugins, running on DBus. The HMI is made in Qml
See also other navigation projects like proof of concepts implemented for poi-service, traffic-info and positioning 

What is in:
This folder contains the code for building Navit and the GENIVI plugins. It runs only the navigation middleware (without the HMI)
FYI: the application (with the HMI) is located into git://git.projects.genivi.org/lbs/navigation-application.git
     it's possible to build and run the whole stuff directly from that repository

Test target: 
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

To get the code:
git clone http://git.projects.genivi.org/lbs/navigation-service.git $WORKING-DIR

NB: potential issue may occur due to path change of freetype stuff. If necessary, add a link to /usr/include/freetype2/ into /usr/include 

Folders:
The code is shared between:
map-viewer/
the plugins for the map rendering and manipulation (zoom, scroll..)
navigation-core/
the plugins for basic navigation features (location input, route calculation...)
poi-cam/
the plugins for poi content access module 
patches/
some patches to complete the navit code

After cloning the additional code and building it, some folders will be added:
bin/
the built code
ilm/
the code of layer manager (not tested)
map/
the map
navit/
basic code of navit
positioning/
the code of positioning

Build scripts (cmake based) are located into:
cd $WORKING-DIR/navigation-service/src/navigation/script

See the README into the script dir for further explanations about how to build and run the code
