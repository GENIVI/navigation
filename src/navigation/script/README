Important notice:
The order of the files included into the Makefile (by include *.mk) has to follow a specific order:
positioning.mk
navit.mk
and others ..
So, the way it's managed is the following:
0 radical added to positioning.mk so now the file name is 0positioning.mk
1 radical added to navit.mk sonow the file name is 1navit.mk
