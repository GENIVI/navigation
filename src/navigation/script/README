For using the layer manager, you need to set the env variable and the paths:
source set-ilm-env.sh

To build the navigation middleware you need first to clone some additional stuff:
./build.sh clone

To build without the layer manager:
./build.sh make

To build with the layer manager:
./build.sh makelm
