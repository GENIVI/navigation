Status: OK

Project:
Navigation software based on Navit and compliant with the Navigation APIs standardized by the GENIVI Alliance
This project is one of the navigation-service common projects that implements the GENIVI navigation APIs.

More:
The GENIVI APIs are implemented into navit plugins, running on DBus. The HMI is made in Qml
See also other navigation projects like proof of concepts implemented for poi-service, traffic-info and positioning 

What is in:
This folder contains scripts for building Navit and the GENIVI plugins. It runs only the navigation middleware (without the HMI)
FYI: the application (with the HMI) is located into git://git.projects.genivi.org/lbs/navigation-application.git
     it's possible to build and run the whole stuff directly from that repository

Test target: 
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

To build the code:

To build the navigation middleware you need first to clone some additional stuff:
./build.sh clone

So, build it:
./build.sh make

And run:
./run 

Issues with Navit:
The current version of Navit used by the code is the r5532. It's an already old version (but the POC runs with it).

Upgrade is under progress, with some issues listed below:

Note 1: There's an issue with the latest version of ksvg2png, that doesn't requires --output into the command line
It's a problem because the png are not correctly generated.
So, please apply the patch
patch -p0 -i ../patches/ksvg2png_remove_output_param.diff
The issue is fixed by the r5827

Note 2: Issues during upgrade
r5549 removed the  get_unique features used by GetSpell
So, please apply the patch
patch -p0 -i ../patches/search_list_get_unique.diff
r5822 removed the attribute distance_metric, it's fixed by the r5898

r5970 Test route calculation is OK, but stability problems when testing the full FSA stuff, to be investigated
